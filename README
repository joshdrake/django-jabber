This is complete copypaste of the fabulous http://github.com/jtauber/django-mailer with modifications 
for sending XMPP messages instead of e-mails.

This should really be integrated in to a single, resusable messaging framework, but I needed a quick hack.
Usage is almost identical to django-mailer, see those docs for details. The differences are outlined below.

=====
Usage
=====

Management Commands
===================

 * ``send_mail`` will clear the current message queue. If there are any
   failures, they will be marked deferred and will not be attempted again by
   ``send_xmpp``.

 * ``retry_xmpp_deferred`` will move any deferred XMPP messages back into the normal queue
   (so it will be attempted again on the next ``send_xmpp``).

XMPP Settings
===================

 * ``JABBER_JID`` what identifier to authenticate with
 * ``JABBER_PASSWORD`` what password to authenticate with
